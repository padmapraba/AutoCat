# AutoCat
AutoCat is a car catalog website for first time car buyers who are not sure about what cars meet their preference. The purpose of this application is to allow the user to narrow their search for cars theyâ€™re interested in based on the make/model, price, fuel type, number of doors, drive wheels, body style, and more.
